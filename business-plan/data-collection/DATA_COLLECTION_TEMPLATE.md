- Customer 2: $25k initial project (Q2) + $3.5k/mo retainer starting Q3 (2 months) = $32k
- Customer 3: $22k initial project (Q3, no retainer) = $22k
- Total Year 1 Revenue: ~$84.5k

Alternative Deal Structures (flexible based on customer needs):
- Small Scope: $15k project (2-3 weeks) for initial validation
- Large Scope: $35-40k project (6-8 weeks) for comprehensive optimization
- Extend Retainer: $5-8k/month for deeper ongoing partnership (3+ days/week)
