Turph AI | Workflow Innovation & Prototyping

MOST COMPANIES KNOW THEY HAVE WORKFLOW PROBLEMS
The challenge isn't identifying problems, it's discovering solutions that actually work. You could hire consultants who design solutions from conference rooms. You could implement off-the-shelf software that doesn't quite fit. Or you could try building it all internally, which takes time you don't have.

There's a better way.

I help companies reshape how tasks are completed by embedding directly with your teams for 4-5 weeks to understand what you're actually trying to accomplish, then reimagine how agentic solutions can enable fundamentally different workflows. Rather than digitizing existing processes, I work on-site, understand the underlying tasks, rapidly prototype agentic solutions using AI tools to accelerate iteration, and test them with real users before you commit significant resources.

Unlike traditional consulting, which relies on assumptions, AI vendors, which push technology first, or traditional UX, which digitizes existing processes, I focus on one thing: reshaping how tasks are completed through agentic solutions.

THE EMBEDDED APPROACH
My process starts with understanding the task, not the process. Week one and two, I embed with your teams. I observe what you're actually trying to accomplish—the underlying task—not just how you do it now. I understand constraints, pain points, and opportunities for fundamental rethink. From there, weeks two through four, I reimagine how agentic solutions can complete those tasks in completely different ways, then prototype rapidly using AI to accelerate iteration—not as the end goal, but as a tool to move quickly. Then weeks four and five, I validate these reshaped workflows with your users to measure what creates real value and what doesn't. By the end of week five, you have working prototypes, tested hypotheses, a clear understanding of how tasks can be completed differently, and a roadmap to implement.

The best part? By staying embedded and understanding tasks rather than just processes, you avoid months of false starts and get fundamental improvements, not incremental.

WHY THIS WORKS
I bring three distinct advantages. First, I'm embedded with your teams, not consulting from a distance. I understand your real constraints, your culture, what you're actually trying to accomplish—not through a client update call, but by being there. Second, I understand underlying tasks and reimagine completion with agentic solutions—not digitize existing processes. Traditional UX digitizes workflows. I reshape how tasks are completed. Third, the speed is fundamentally different. Rapid iteration cycles using AI tools let you validate reshaped workflows and pivot weeks faster than traditional consulting allows.

My background gives me credibility across complex environments. I scaled Amazon's Product Ads from startup to $250M annual business—that's product thinking at scale. I've spent 15+ years leading product design and digital transformation at companies like Fidelity, understanding regulated industries and complex workflows. My environmental consulting background means I've spent time on job sites, understanding operational constraints. And my DARPA research experience gives me insight into defense, aerospace, and high-complexity team coordination.

READY TO EXPLORE?
If you're curious about discovering what's possible in your workflow, and whether a 4-5 week embedded engagement could unlock new opportunities, let's talk. I'm interested in understanding your biggest workflow challenges and exploring if this approach makes sense.
