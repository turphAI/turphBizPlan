# COHESIVE MESSAGING FRAMEWORKS: Title, Description, Tag, Mission

## Overview

This document presents complete messaging frameworks for each Category 1 business tag option. Each framework includes all 4 components working together as one cohesive message:

2. **Short LinkedIn Description** - What you actually do (1-2 sentences)
3. **Business Tag** - Core identifier
4. **Short Mission Statement** - Core purpose/value proposition
