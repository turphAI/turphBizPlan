# Alternative Words to "Workflow" for Intelligence Framework

## The Question
You like "Workflow Intelligence" but feel "workflow" might be a bit off. What word sits between "Workflow" (too technical/step-focused?) and "Process" (too abstract/consulting-focused?)?

## Word Spectrum Analysis

**Workflow** → [Gap] → **Process**

- **Workflow**: Sequential steps, technical, flow-oriented
