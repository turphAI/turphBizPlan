# One-Pager: Workflow Innovation & Prototyping

## Tom Murphy | Workflow Innovation & Prototyping

### Discover and validate workflow improvements faster.

I help enterprises identify workflow opportunities through embedded user research and rapid AI-accelerated prototyping.

---

## What I Do

I embed directly with your teams for 4-5 weeks to:

1. **Deeply understand** actual workflows and pain points (not assumptions)
2. **Rapidly prototype** solutions using AI tools for speed
3. **Validate improvements** with real users before committing to anything
4. **Deliver roadmap** with clear next steps and implementation guidance

Unlike traditional consulting (assumptions-based) or AI vendors (technology-first), I focus on discovering what **actually works** for your teams.

## Why It Works

**Embedded Expertise**  
I'm on-site with your teams, not consulting from a distance. I understand the real constraints and opportunities of your actual work.

**Real Data-Driven**  
Prototypes are grounded in actual workflows and user feedback, not hypothetical designs or vendor assumptions.

**AI-Accelerated Speed**  
Rapid iteration cycles that traditional consulting can't match, letting you validate ideas fast before committing resources.
