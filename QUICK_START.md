# Forward Deployed AIX: Project Quick Start Guide

## You're All Set! Here's What I've Created

Your agentic business planning system is now ready. I've set up:

### ✅ Project Structure
```
bizPlan/
├── README.md                    # Project overview
├── CONCEPT.md                   # Your business concept
├── WORKFLOW.md                  # Complete execution workflow
├── .cursor/rules/               # Quality standards
├── .cursor/skills/              # Agent skills library
├── data/                        # Your input data
└── outputs/                     # Generated business plan
```

### ✅ Cursor Rules (Quality Standards)
- **business-writing.md** - Professional tone, structure, clarity
- **financial-standards.md** - Realistic projections, transparency, credibility

### ✅ Agent Skill (Ready to Use)
- **Market Analysis Skill** - Complete guide to sizing TAM/SAM/SOM, identifying trends, customer personas

### ✅ Workflow & Templates
- **WORKFLOW.md** - Phase-by-phase execution plan with timing
- **DATA_COLLECTION_TEMPLATE.md** - Structured template for gathering all necessary info

## How to Proceed: Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Fill Out Your Data (Today - 1-2 hours)

Start with the data collection template:

```
Open: /data/DATA_COLLECTION_TEMPLATE.md
```

Fill in as much as you know about:
- Your company vision, mission, and positioning
- Service offering and engagement model
- Target markets and customer profiles
- Go-to-market strategy
- Financial assumptions
- Team information
- Competitive advantages

**Tip**: Don't worry about perfect answers. Rough ideas are fine; you'll refine them through the skill-based process.

### Step 2: Use the Market Analysis Skill (Tomorrow - 4-6 hours)

When ready, tell me:

```
I want to use the Market Analysis Skill to develop our market analysis.

Current understanding:
[Key info from your data collection]

I want to generate:
- TAM/SAM/SOM analysis
- Market trends and growth drivers
- Customer personas
- Competitive positioning

Output file:
/outputs/business-plan/02-market-analysis.md
```

I'll guide you through the systematic process in MARKET ANALYSIS SKILL to produce a professional, data-backed market analysis section.

### Step 3: Apply Remaining Skills (Parallel Execution)

Once market analysis is done, invoke additional skills:
- Competitive Analysis
- Product/Service Definition
- Go-to-Market Strategy
- Financial Projections
- Team & Organization

These can happen in parallel (each takes 2-5 hours).

### Step 4: Synthesize Executive Summary (Final)

After all other sections, create the executive summary that ties everything together.

### Step 5: Generate Elevator Pitches & Decks

Use specialized skills to create:
- 30-second elevator pitch
- 60-second elevator pitch
- Seed-round pitch deck
- Series A pitch deck
