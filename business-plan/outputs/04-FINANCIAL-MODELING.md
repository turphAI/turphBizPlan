# PHASE 3: FINANCIAL MODELING & PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS

## Strategic Goal

Build a realistic financial model for a self-funded forward-deployed workflow prototyping services business, answering: **"Can I hit my $50K personal income goal?"**

---

## 1. REVENUE MODEL

### Pricing Strategy

Based on market research and competitive analysis, your pricing model:

#### Service 1: Initial Engagement (Project-Based)

**Small Scope: $15-25K**
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks embedded
- Scope: Quick workflow validation, limited discovery
- Deliverables: 1-2 prototypes, validation summary, basic roadmap
- Use Case: Smaller companies, single workflow focus, quick validation
- Example: Mid-market e-commerce testing checkout workflow

**Standard Scope: $40-60K** ← TARGET OFFERING
- Timeline: 4-5 weeks embedded
- Scope: Deep discovery, multiple workflows, comprehensive prototyping
- Deliverables: 3-5 prototypes, detailed analysis, comprehensive roadmap
- Use Case: Most enterprises, primary engagement
- Example: Financial services firm optimizing advisor + operations workflows

**Large Scope: $75-100K**
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks embedded
- Scope: Multiple teams, complex workflows, extensive optimization
- Deliverables: 5-8 prototypes, multi-workflow analysis, strategic roadmap
- Use Case: Enterprise clients, multiple departments
- Example: Major construction firm optimizing job site + back-office workflows

**Average Initial Engagement: $50K** (used for modeling)

#### Service 2: Ongoing Retainer (Monthly Recurring)

**Light Retainer: $2-3K/month**
- Scope: 1 day/week optimization and iteration
- Deliverables: Monthly prototype cycles, optimization recommendations
- Duration: Typically 3-6 months
- Ideal For: Clients wanting to continue after initial engagement

**Standard Retainer: $3-5K/month** ← TARGET RETAINER
- Scope: 2 days/week optimization, iteration, new prototypes
- Deliverables: Weekly iterations, monthly strategic reviews
- Duration: Typically 6-12+ months
- Ideal For: Most clients wanting ongoing engagement

**Deep Retainer: $5-8K/month**
- Scope: 3+ days/week embedded optimization
- Deliverables: Daily iterations, weekly strategic reviews
- Duration: Typically 6-12+ months
- Ideal For: Enterprise clients with multiple ongoing initiatives

**Average Retainer: $4K/month** (used for modeling)

### Revenue Mix Assumption

- **Year 1-2:** 30% from retainers, 70% from initial projects (building base)
- **Year 3-5:** 50-60% from retainers, 40-50% from initial projects (recurring base grows)

---

## 2. UNIT ECONOMICS

### Customer Acquisition

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**How You Acquire Customers (Self-Funded Model):**
1. **Network outreach** (60% of leads) - free/minimal cost
   - LinkedIn outreach
   - Warm introductions
   - Your existing network (Fidelity, Amazon, CRA)
   - Cost: $0-500 per customer

2. **Content/Thought leadership** (30% of leads) - moderate cost
   - Blog posts, case studies, speaking
   - LinkedIn articles
   - Industry conference presentations
   - Cost: $500-2K per customer

3. **Paid advertising** (10% of leads) - higher cost
   - LinkedIn ads (if needed)
   - Industry publications
   - Cost: $2-5K per customer (not recommended early)

**Blended CAC Estimate:**
- Year 1: $1,500-3,000 per customer (expensive, building foundation)
- Year 2-3: $1,000-2,000 per customer (leverage referrals)
- Year 4-5: $500-1,000 per customer (referrals + reputation)

**Why Self-Funded CAC is Lower:**
- No sales team overhead
- Network-based acquisition
- Referrals from early customers
- Thought leadership compound over time

**Target CAC: $1,500 (Year 1-2) → $750 (Year 3+)**

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

#### Typical Customer Journey

**Customer 1 (Year 1):**
- Initial project: $50K
- Retainer (6 months @ $4K): $24K
- Total: $74K over 18 months
- LTV: $74K

**Customer 2 (Year 2):**
- Initial project: $50K
- Retainer (12 months @ $4K): $48K
- Second project (Year 3): $50K
- Total: $148K over 24+ months
- LTV: $148K+

**Benchmark LTV (Average):**
- **Short cycle** (project only, no retainer): $50K
- **Medium cycle** (project + 6-month retainer): $74K
- **Long cycle** (project + ongoing retainer): $100-150K+
- **Target LTV: $80K** (mix of short/medium/long cycle)

---

### Key Unit Economics Ratios

| Metric | Target | Industry Benchmark | Your Model |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **LTV/CAC Ratio** | 3:1 minimum | 3-5:1 healthy | 53:1 ($80K/$1.5K) ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **CAC Payback Period** | <12 months | 12-24 months | 2-4 months ✅ VERY FAST |
| **Gross Margin** | 60%+ for recurring | 50-70% | 65-75% ✅ STRONG |
| **Annual Revenue per Customer** | $40-80K | $30-100K | $50-100K ✅ ON TARGET |
| **Churn Rate** | <10% annually | 5-15% | 5-10% (assumed) ✅ REASONABLE |

**Assessment: EXCELLENT unit economics for self-funded model**

## 5. PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS

### Break-Even Analysis

**Question: When do you cover your $50K personal income need?**

**Answer: Month 1-2 of Year 1**

- First customer project at $50K covers a year of overhead
- Additional projects = profit
- Conservative case breaks even at ~2 customers
- **You're profitable from the start in all scenarios**

### Cash Flow Considerations

**Important Note:** Timing matters. Assuming standard payment terms:

- **50% upfront** at engagement start
- **50% on delivery** at end of engagement (weeks 4-5)

**Year 1 Cash Flow (Conservative - 2 customers):**

| Timeline | Cash In | Cash Out | Net Cash |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| Month 1 (Cust 1 starts) | $25K | $2K | +$23K |
| Month 2 | $0 | $2K | -$2K |
| Month 3 | $0 | $2K | -$2K |
| Month 4 | $0 | $2K | -$2K |
| Month 5 (Cust 1 ends) | $25K | $3K | +$22K |
| Month 6 (Cust 2 starts) | $25K | $2K | +$23K |
| Months 7-10 | $0 | $2K each | -$8K |
| Month 11 (Cust 2 ends) | $25K | $3K | +$22K |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$100K** | **$25K** | **+$75K** |

**Cash Position:** You're cash-positive from month 5, with $75K cash after all Year 1 expenses.

## 6. PATH TO $50K PERSONAL INCOME GOAL

### Year-by-Year Analysis

**Year 1: Conservative Case**
- Revenue: $100K
- Operating Expenses: $23K
- Profit: $77K
- **Your Take-Home: $54K ✅ GOAL EXCEEDED by $4K**

**Year 1: Base Case**
- Revenue: $150K
- Operating Expenses: $25.5K
- Profit: $124.5K
- **Your Take-Home: $87K ✅ GOAL EXCEEDED by $37K**

**Year 1: Optimistic Case**
- Revenue: $262K
- Operating Expenses: $32.5K
- Profit: $229.5K
- **Your Take-Home: $161K ✅ GOAL EXCEEDED by $111K**

### Key Insight
**You hit your $50K goal in YEAR 1 across all scenarios** — even in the most conservative case with just 2 customers.

---

## 7. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### What Happens If...

#### Scenario A: You Get Only 1 Customer in Year 1

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Year 1 Revenue | $50K (just 1 project) |
| Year 1 Profit | $27K |
| Your Take-Home | ~$19K |
| **Status:** ❌ Below goal |
| **Action:** 2nd customer in Q2 gets you to goal |

**Insight:** You need at least 1-2 projects to hit your goal. Very achievable with your network.

---

#### Scenario B: Retainers Underperform (Lower Conversion)

**Assumption:** Only 20% of customers take retainer (vs. 30-50% assumed)

**Impact on Year 3:**
- Project Revenue: $200K (unchanged)
- Retainer Revenue: $20K (vs. $48K assumed)
- Total Revenue: $220K (vs. $248K)
- Your Take-Home: ~$140K (still well above goal)

**Insight:** Even with lower retainer conversion, you exceed your goal significantly.

---

#### Scenario C: Pricing Pressure (Lower Average Project Size)

**Assumption:** Average project $35K (vs. $50K assumed)

**Year 1 Conservative (2 customers):**
- Revenue: $70K
- Your Take-Home: ~$40K
- **Status:** ❌ Slightly below goal

**Year 1 Conservative with 3 projects:**
- Revenue: $105K
- Your Take-Home: ~$60K
- **Status:** ✅ Above goal

**Insight:** Pricing is important but not critical. Volume can compensate.

## 8. REALISTIC FIRST-YEAR FORECAST

### Most Likely Outcome: Base Case with Adjustments

**Year 1 Realistic Projection:**

| Quarter | Activity | Revenue | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| Q1 | Build brand, network, 1 customer starts | $25K | Project $1 (50% upfront) |
| Q2 | Project 1 ends, Project 2 starts, networking | $50K | P1 (50% close) + P2 (50% start) |
| Q3 | Project 2 ongoing, Project 3 starts | $50K | P2 (50% close) + P3 (50% start) |
| Q4 | Project 3 ongoing, retainer exploration | $50K | P3 (50% close) + retainer starts |
| **Year 1 Total** | **3 projects, 1 retainer starting** | **$175K** | **Mid-range between conservative and base** |

**Your Year 1 Take-Home: ~$100K after expenses and taxes**

---

## 9. KEY FINANCIAL METRICS SUMMARY

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Year 1 Revenue Target** | $100-262K (range) | On track to exceed |
