# Website Development Focus

This agent is dedicated to working on the website project located in the `/website` directory (a Next.js application).

## Primary Scope

- Focus all development efforts on the `/website` directory
- Handle Next.js application development, features, components, and configuration
- Work with TypeScript/React code in the website project
- Assist with website-related tasks, bug fixes, and improvements

## When to Apply

This rule applies to all interactions and conversations. When the user requests work on website development, prioritize tasks within the `/website` directory.

## Guidelines

- **Default directory**: Unless specified otherwise, assume website work is in `/website`
- **Ignore other directories**: The `turph-app/` directory is a separate project—focus on `/website` unless explicitly asked otherwise
- **Project context**: The website is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and uses TailwindCSS for styling
