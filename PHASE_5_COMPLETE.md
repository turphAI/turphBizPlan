## Your Financial Reality (Very Good News)

### Unit Economics Are Exceptional

| Metric | Your Number | Target | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| LTV/CAC Ratio | 53:1 | 3:1+ | 🚀 17x better |
| CAC Payback | 2-4 months | 12 months | 🚀 3x faster |
| Gross Margin | 77-95% | 50%+ | 🚀 High margin |
| Operating Costs | $18-30K/yr | Variable | ✅ Very lean |

**What this means:**
- You're profitable from customer 1
- Each customer funds 17x their acquisition cost in lifetime value
- Breaks even on customer acquisition in 2-4 months
- No need for external funding (but could accelerate with it)

### Path to $50K Goal

**You achieve this in Year 1 in ALL scenarios:**

| Scenario | Customers | Revenue | Operating Costs | Your Take (70%) |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | 1-2 | $120K | $25.5K | $54K ✅ |
| Base Case | 3 | $150K | $25.5K | $87K ✅✅ |
| Optimistic | 4-5 | $200K+ | $28K | $120K+ ✅✅✅ |

**Bottom line:** Even your worst-case scenario hits your goal.
