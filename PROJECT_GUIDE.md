## When You're Ready for the Formal Plan

Once you've had 10-15 conversations and validated your model:

**Use Agent Skills to generate formal sections**:
1. Market Analysis Skill (if needed for investor pitch)
2. Competitive Analysis Skill
3. Financial Projections Skill
4. Executive Summary Skill

This will produce professional business plan sections in `/business-plan/outputs/`

**Then synthesize into final document**: `BUSINESS_PLAN.md`
