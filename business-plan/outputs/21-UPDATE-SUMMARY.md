## Key Language Changes Applied Across All Documents

### ✅ New Language (Operations Intelligence Framework)

**Tag/Title:**
- Operations Intelligence (not "Workflow Intelligence", "AIX", "UX")
- Principal, Operations Intelligence

**Core Language:**
- "Outcomes they need" (not "what needs to happen", "what users are trying to accomplish")
- "Outcomes teams need" (not "workflow problems", "process optimization")
- "Accomplish them differently" (not "digitize processes", "optimize workflows")
- "Reshape operations" (not "workflow optimization", "process improvement")
- "By prototyping and validating" (natural flow, no hyphen)

**Team Language:**
- "Teams" (not "enterprise teams" in descriptions - enterprise is the client)
- "Embed with teams" (not "front-line workers" - too limiting)

**Avoided:**
- ❌ UX/AIX language
- ❌ "Workflow" as primary focus (replaced with "operations")
- ❌ "What needs to happen" (too soft)
- ❌ "Enterprise teams" in description (enterprise is client)
- ❌ Hyphens/em dashes that look AI-generated
