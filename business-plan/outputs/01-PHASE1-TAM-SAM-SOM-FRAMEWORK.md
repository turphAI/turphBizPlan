# PHASE 1: MARKET RESEARCH EXECUTION GUIDE

## Target Markets (Priority Order)
1. **Financial Services** (highest priority - your strongest network)
2. **Defense/Aerospace** (DARPA/CRA background)
3. **Construction/Environmental** (consulting experience)
4. **E-commerce/Marketplaces** (Amazon background)

## Part 1: TAM/SAM/SOM Analysis

### Step 1: Define TAM (Total Addressable Market)

**Starting Point: Global AI Services Market**

Known data points:
- Gartner estimates: AI services market ~$25-30B in 2024
- Growing at CAGR 30-40% through 2030
- Forward-deployed AI represents emerging segment (15-30% of market, growing)

**Your TAM Calculation:**
- Global AI services: $25-30B
- Forward-deployed AI portion: 20-30% (increasing)
- **Estimated TAM: $5-9B globally**

### Step 2: Define SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)

Breaking down by target market:

**Financial Services:**
- TAM percentage: 30-35% of forward-deployed AI market
- Includes: Banks, insurance, wealth management, trading firms, fintech

**Defense/Aerospace:**
- TAM percentage: 20-25% of forward-deployed AI market
- Includes: Defense contractors, aerospace, government agencies

**Construction/Environmental:**
- TAM percentage: 15-20% of forward-deployed AI market
- Includes: Construction firms, environmental consulting, engineering

**E-commerce/Marketplaces:**
- TAM percentage: 15-20% of forward-deployed AI market
- Includes: Retail, marketplaces, logistics, operations

**Total SAM** = TAM × (35% + 25% + 20% + 20%) = TAM × 100%
- But SAM is really your addressable portion
- **Conservative SAM: $3-5B across your 4 markets**

### Step 3: Define SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

**5-Year Revenue Target with Market Share Assumptions:**

- Year 1: 0.01% market share = minimal traction
- Year 2: 0.05% market share = establishing presence
- Year 3: 0.15% market share = recognized player
- Year 4-5: 0.25-0.5% market share = established

**SOM Calculation:**
- Conservative: 5-year revenue at 0.25% market share
- If SAM = $4B: $4B × 0.25% = $10M annual by Year 5
- Optimistic: 5-year revenue at 0.5% market share
- If SAM = $4B: $4B × 0.5% = $20M annual by Year 5

**For self-funded model:**
- Year 1-2: Focus on profitability (not growth)
- Year 3-5: Sustainable scaling
- **Target SOM: $10-20M annual revenue by Year 5**
