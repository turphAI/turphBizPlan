# CORE DIFFERENTIATOR: THE VALUE OF EMBEDDED WORK

## The Critical Distinction

### Traditional UX Approach (What Most Do)
**Process:** Understand existing workflow → Digitize it → Optimize the digital version

**Limitation:** Takes existing processes as given and simply moves them to digital platforms. Assumes the current way of completing tasks is optimal.

**Example:** A financial advisor currently fills out forms manually → Traditional UX digitizes those forms → Creates a digital form-filling experience

**Problem:** The underlying task (documenting client information) hasn't been reimagined. You've just made the existing process digital.

---

### Our Embedded Approach (What We Do)
**Process:** Understand the underlying TASK → Reimagine how it can be completed differently → Prototype agentic solutions

**Value:** Identifies what users are actually trying to accomplish (the task), then reimagines how agentic/AI solutions can complete that task in fundamentally different—and better—ways.

**Example:** A financial advisor needs to document client information → We understand the task (capturing accurate client data for compliance and service) → We reimagine: What if an AI agent could extract information from conversations, auto-populate forms, and flag inconsistencies? → The process becomes completely different, not just digitized.

**Result:** The workflow is reshaped and rethought, not just digitized. Agentic solutions enable entirely new ways of completing tasks.

---

## Why This Matters: The Huge Value Add

### 1. Task Understanding vs. Process Digitization

**Traditional UX:**
- Observes: "Users fill out forms manually"
- Solution: "Let's create a digital form"
- Outcome: Same process, now digital

**Our Approach:**
- Observes: "Users need to capture accurate client information"
- Understands: The underlying task is documentation + compliance + relationship building
- Reimagines: "What if AI agents could handle documentation automatically, freeing advisors for relationship building?"
- Outcome: Completely different workflow that's better, not just digitized

---

### 2. Agentic Solutions Enable Fundamental Rethink

**Key Insight:** Agentic/AI solutions don't just automate existing processes—they enable entirely new ways of completing tasks.

**Traditional Digitization:**
- Takes human process → Makes it digital
- Assumes: Humans do it best, technology just makes it faster
- Result: Incremental improvement

**Agentic Rethink:**
- Understands: What is the task trying to accomplish?
- Reimagines: How can agents + humans collaborate differently?
- Result: Fundamental improvement, not incremental

**Example:**
- **Traditional:** Digitize manual data entry → Faster data entry
- **Agentic:** Understand data capture task → AI agent extracts from conversations → Human reviews and adds context → Completely different workflow

---

### 3. The Embedded Advantage

**Why Being Embedded Matters:**

**Remote/Consulting Approach:**
- Observes processes from outside
- Sees: "This is how they do it now"
- Tends to: Digitize what exists

**Embedded Approach:**
- Lives the workflows alongside users
- Sees: "This is what they're actually trying to accomplish"
- Tends to: Reimagine how tasks can be completed differently

**The Difference:**
- Embedded = Understanding the task, not just the process
- Embedded = Seeing opportunities for fundamental rethink
- Embedded = Validating agentic solutions with real users

## How This Shows Up in Our Work

### Phase 1: Embedded Discovery (Weeks 1-2)

**What We're NOT Doing:**
- ❌ Mapping existing processes to digitize them
- ❌ Asking "How can we make this digital?"
- ❌ Assuming current workflows are optimal

**What We ARE Doing:**
- ✅ Understanding what users are actually trying to accomplish (the task)
- ✅ Identifying constraints, pain points, and opportunities
- ✅ Asking "What if this task could be completed completely differently?"
- ✅ Exploring how agentic solutions could reshape workflows

**Example:**
- **Traditional:** "How can we digitize this manual process?"
- **Our Approach:** "What is the underlying task? How can agentic solutions enable a fundamentally different approach?"

---

### Phase 2: Prototyping (Weeks 2-4)

**What We're NOT Building:**
- ❌ Digital versions of existing processes
- ❌ Optimized versions of current workflows
- ❌ Incremental improvements

**What We ARE Building:**
- ✅ Prototypes that reimagine task completion
- ✅ Agentic solutions that enable new workflows
- ✅ Fundamental improvements, not incremental

**Example:**
- **Traditional Prototype:** Digital form-filling system
- **Our Prototype:** AI agent that extracts information from conversations, auto-populates documentation, flags inconsistencies, and enables human review—completely different workflow

---

### Phase 3: Validation (Weeks 4-5)

**What We're NOT Validating:**
- ❌ "Is this digital version better than the manual version?"
- ❌ "Do users prefer the digital process?"

**What We ARE Validating:**
- ✅ "Does this reimagined approach actually work better?"
- ✅ "Do users see value in the fundamentally different workflow?"
- ✅ "Can agentic solutions complete tasks in better ways?"

## Key Messaging: How to Communicate This

### The Elevator Pitch Version

**"I don't digitize existing processes—I understand what users are actually trying to accomplish, then reimagine how agentic solutions can complete those tasks in fundamentally different ways. Traditional UX digitizes workflows. I reshape them."**

---

### The Full Explanation

**"Most workflow optimization takes existing processes and digitizes them. That's incremental improvement. What I do is different: I embed with teams to understand what they're actually trying to accomplish—the underlying task—then I reimagine how agentic solutions can enable completely different ways of completing those tasks.**

**For example, instead of digitizing manual form-filling, I might discover that the real task is capturing accurate client information. Then I prototype an agentic solution where AI extracts information from conversations, auto-populates documentation, and flags inconsistencies—freeing humans for relationship building. That's not digitization, that's reimagining.**

**The embedded approach is critical because you can't reimagine workflows from a distance. You need to understand the actual tasks, constraints, and opportunities. Then agentic solutions enable fundamentally different approaches—not just faster versions of existing processes."**

---

### The Value Proposition

**"Traditional UX digitizes existing processes. We reshape how tasks are completed.**

**We embed with your teams to understand what you're actually trying to accomplish—the underlying task—not just how you do it now. Then we reimagine how agentic solutions can enable completely different workflows.**

**The result? Fundamental improvements, not incremental. Workflows that are better, not just digitized."**
