Turph AI | Workflow Innovation & Prototyping

MOST COMPANIES KNOW THEY HAVE WORKFLOW PROBLEMS
The challenge isn't identifying problems, it's discovering solutions that actually work. You could hire consultants who design solutions from conference rooms. You could implement off-the-shelf software that doesn't quite fit. Or you could try building it all internally, which takes time you don't have.

There's a better way.

I help companies move faster by embedding directly with your teams for 4-5 weeks to discover and validate workflow improvements grounded in real user data. Rather than designing solutions in a vacuum, I work on-site, understand your actual constraints and opportunities, rapidly prototype multiple possibilities using AI tools to accelerate iteration, and test them with real users before you commit significant resources.

Unlike traditional consulting, which relies on assumptions, or AI vendors, which push technology first, I focus on one thing: discovering what actually works for your teams.

THE EMBEDDED APPROACH
My process starts with understanding. Week one and two, I embed with your teams. I observe actual workflows, conduct user interviews, and map the real pain points—not what people think happens, but what actually happens. From there, weeks two through four, I prototype multiple solutions using AI to accelerate iteration—not as the end goal, but as a tool to move quickly. Then weeks four and five, I validate these prototypes with your users to measure what creates real value and what doesn't. By the end of week five, you have working prototypes, tested hypotheses, a clear understanding of what works, and a roadmap to implement.

The best part? By staying embedded and working with real data, you avoid months of false starts and misaligned solutions.

WHY THIS WORKS
I bring three distinct advantages. First, I'm embedded with your teams, not consulting from a distance. I understand your real constraints, your culture, how your teams actually work—not through a client update call, but by being there. Second, everything is data-driven, grounded in how your teams actually work, not vendor assumptions or my hypotheses. Third, the speed is fundamentally different. Rapid iteration cycles using AI tools let you validate ideas and pivot weeks faster than traditional consulting allows.

My background gives me credibility across complex environments. I scaled Amazon's Product Ads from startup to $250M annual business—that's product thinking at scale. I've spent 15+ years leading product design and digital transformation at companies like Fidelity, understanding regulated industries and complex workflows. My environmental consulting background means I've spent time on job sites, understanding operational constraints. And my DARPA research experience gives me insight into defense, aerospace, and high-complexity team coordination.

READY TO EXPLORE?
If you're curious about discovering what's possible in your workflow, and whether a 4-5 week embedded engagement could unlock new opportunities, let's talk. I'm interested in understanding your biggest workflow challenges and exploring if this approach makes sense.
