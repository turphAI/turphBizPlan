## When to Use This Skill

**Invoke this skill when:**

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Your Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Objective**: Estimate the total annual revenue opportunity if you captured 100% of forward-deployed AI services globally.

**Approach - Top Down** (starting from industry data):
1. Start with AI services market size (Gartner, IDC, McKinsey reports)
2. Identify forward-deployed AI as percentage of total AI market (estimate: 15-30% today, growing to 40-50%)
3. Calculate TAM as: AI Services Market × Forward Deployment Percentage

**Approach - Bottom Up** (building from potential customers):
1. Estimate number of enterprises globally that could benefit: $1B+ revenue companies, high operational complexity
2. Apply reasonable market penetration assumptions
3. Calculate TAM as: # of Potential Customers × Average Annual Spend on Forward-Deployed AI

**Deliverable**: 
- Single TAM figure with range (e.g., "$8-12 billion global TAM")
- Document the calculation method and sources
- Show sensitivity (what if 10% higher/lower)

### Step 2: Define Your Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Objective**: Identify the revenue opportunity in segments where you'll compete with your specific offering.

**Key Segments for Forward Deployed AIX:**

| Segment | Description | Potential Size | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Financial Services** | Trading, risk, compliance, fraud detection | 25-35% of TAM | Large budgets, complex operations |
| **Healthcare** | Clinical systems, diagnostics, operations | 20-30% of TAM | Highly regulated, proven use cases |
| **Industrial/Manufacturing** | Predictive maintenance, process optimization | 15-25% of TAM | Growing operational focus on AI |
| **Technology/Enterprise Software** | Internal operations, customer systems | 10-20% of TAM | Tech-forward, faster adoption |
| **Government/Defense** | Operations, intelligence, efficiency | 10-15% of TAM | High value, long cycles |
| **Telecommunications** | Network optimization, customer service | 5-10% of TAM | Emerging opportunity |

**Exercise:**
1. Choose your initial target segments (recommend 2-3 for first market entry)
2. Calculate SAM as: TAM × (% of target segments)
3. Document why these segments are prioritized

**Example:**
- Global TAM: $10B
- Target segments: Financial Services (30%) + Healthcare (25%) = 55%
- **SAM = $10B × 0.55 = $5.5B**

**Deliverable**:
- SAM figure with segment breakdown
- Justification for segment selection
- 2-3 pages of segment analysis (size, growth rates, buyer personas)

### Step 3: Define Your Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Objective**: Realistic revenue you can capture in 5 years based on market share assumptions.

**Market Share Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 0.01% of SAM (proving capability)
- Year 2: 0.05% of SAM (scaling)
- Year 3: 0.15% of SAM (established player)
- Year 4-5: 0.25-0.5% of SAM (meaningful market presence)

**Calculate SOM:**
- Conservative: 5-year SAM share of 0.25% = SAM × 0.0025
- Optimistic: 5-year SAM share of 0.5% = SAM × 0.005
- Use the conservative figure in business plan, optimistic for upside scenario

**Example:**
- SAM: $5.5B
- Conservative SOM (5 years): $5.5B × 0.25% = $13.75M annual revenue
- Optimistic SOM (5 years): $5.5B × 0.5% = $27.5M annual revenue

**Deliverable**:
- 5-year revenue target (SOM)
- Market share assumptions documented
- Path to SOM (Year 1, 2, 3 targets)
