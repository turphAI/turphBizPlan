## PART 1: THE CORE STORY (2-3 Minutes)

### The Full Narrative

**"I've spent 20 years solving customer problems at companies like Amazon and Fidelity. At Amazon, I scaled Product Ads from startup to $250M—that's product thinking at scale. At Fidelity, I'm designing systems for millions of users in highly regulated environments.**

**But here's what I kept seeing: enterprises know they have workflow problems, but they're stuck. They can hire consultants who take 6-12 months and cost $500K-$5M. They can hire AI firms who jump straight to building without understanding workflows. Or they can build internal teams, which takes 18-24 months and costs a fortune.**

**None of these work for validation—the critical first step. And that's the gap I saw: everyone's trying to solve workflow optimization, but nobody's helping companies discover what actually works before committing millions.**

**So I'm building something different. I embed directly with enterprise teams for 4-5 weeks. I understand what users are actually trying to accomplish—the underlying task—not just how they do it now. Then I reimagine how agentic solutions can complete those tasks in fundamentally different ways. I rapidly prototype these reshaped workflows using AI tools to accelerate iteration. And I validate everything with real users before they commit to anything.**

**The critical difference: Traditional UX digitizes existing processes. I reshape how tasks are completed. I don't take your current workflow and make it digital—I understand what you're trying to accomplish, then reimagine how agentic solutions can enable completely different workflows.**

**The result? They know exactly what improvements will drive ROI through fundamental changes, not incremental. They have working prototypes. They have an implementation roadmap. All in 4-5 weeks instead of 6-12 months. All for $25-100K instead of $500K-$5M.**

**Here's where I see this heading: In 5-10 years, this embedded prototyping model becomes the standard for enterprise workflow optimization. Companies won't commit to massive implementations without validating first. They'll use rapid, task-first prototyping to discover how agentic solutions can reshape workflows, then scale what's proven. AI accelerates the iteration, but understanding underlying tasks drives the direction.**

**What makes this different isn't just speed or cost—it's that I'm combining task understanding with agentic solution reimagining. Most AI firms start with tech. Most consulting firms start with strategy. Most UX firms digitize existing processes. I start with understanding what users are actually trying to accomplish, then reimagine how agentic solutions can complete those tasks differently. That intersection—task understanding plus agentic reimagining plus AI acceleration—is what changes outcomes fundamentally.**

**I'm starting with financial services, defense, construction, and e-commerce because I have credibility in each. But the model scales. The vision is that every enterprise workflow improvement starts with embedded validation, not assumptions."**

**Time:** 2-3 minutes  
**Tone:** Conversational, authentic, forward-looking  
**Key Elements:** Personal journey, gap identification, vision, differentiation woven in

## PART 2: MULTIPLE FORMATS

### Format A: 30-Second Hook (Opening Line)

**Version 1 (Vision-Focused):**
*"I'm building the future of enterprise workflow optimization—where companies validate improvements in weeks, not months, before committing millions."*

**Version 2 (Differentiation-Focused):**
*"I help enterprises discover workflow improvements by combining user research with AI acceleration—the intersection that actually changes outcomes."*

**Version 3 (Problem-Focused):**
*"Enterprises spend millions on workflow optimization that fails. I help them discover what actually works before committing—in 4-5 weeks instead of 6-12 months."*

**Version 4 (Personal-Focused):**
*"After 20 years at Amazon and Fidelity solving customer problems, I'm building a new model for enterprise workflow validation—fast, affordable, user-driven."*

**How to Use:**
- Pick one that feels natural to you
- Use it as your opening line when asked "What are you working on?"
- Pause after saying it (let them ask questions)
- Then transition to the 2-3 minute story if they're interested

---

### Format B: 2-3 Minute Full Story

**See "The Core Story" above (Part 1)**

**Delivery Tips:**
- Start with personal background (builds credibility)
- Identify the gap naturally (not as a pitch, but as observation)
- Paint the vision (where this is heading)
- Weave differentiation into the narrative (not a list)
- End with forward-looking statement
- Pause for questions throughout

---

### Format C: Conversation Starters & Adaptive Responses

**When They Ask: "How did you come up with this?"**

*"I kept seeing the same pattern: companies would spend months and millions on workflow improvements that didn't work. At Amazon, we validated everything with users first. At Fidelity, I see enterprises struggling with the same problem. The gap was clear: there's no good way to validate workflow improvements before committing. So I'm building that."*

**When They Ask: "What makes you different from [competitor]?"**

*"Great question. They're great at [their strength], but here's the difference: I start with user research to understand what actually needs to change, then use AI to prototype and validate fast. Most AI firms start with tech. Most consultants start with strategy. I start with understanding workflows, then accelerate with AI. That intersection changes outcomes."*

**When They Ask: "Where do you see this in 5 years?"**

*"I see embedded prototyping becoming the standard for enterprise workflow optimization. Companies won't commit to massive implementations without validating first. They'll use rapid, user-driven prototyping to discover what works, then scale what's proven. AI accelerates iteration, but user research drives direction. That's the future."*

**When They Ask: "Who are your customers?"**

*"I'm starting with financial services, defense, construction, and e-commerce—markets where I have credibility. Financial services because I'm at Fidelity. Defense because I've done DARPA work. Construction because I have environmental consulting background. E-commerce because I scaled Amazon Product Ads. But the model works across industries."*

**When They Ask: "How are you getting traction?"**

*"I'm taking a network-first approach. I have strong relationships in each target market, so I'm starting with people I know. The goal is to get 2-3 customers in Year 1, build case studies, then scale. The unit economics are strong—LTV/CAC of 53:1, so each customer funds growth. I'm profitable from customer one."*

**Questions to Ask Them (Builds Rapport):**

- "What are you working on?"
- "What's your biggest challenge right now?"
- "How are you thinking about [their domain]?"
- "What's your go-to-market strategy?"
- "Who are your customers?"
- "What's been your biggest learning so far?"

**Ways to Connect Your Story to Theirs:**

- If they're B2B: "You're probably seeing the same enterprise workflow challenges I am."
- If they're SaaS: "Your customers probably struggle with workflow optimization—that's my market."
- If they're early-stage: "You're validating fast—that's exactly what I help enterprises do."
- If they're service-based: "You understand embedded client work—that's my model."
- If they're tech-focused: "You're building with AI—I'm using it to accelerate validation."

## PART 3: VISION-FOCUSED NARRATIVE

### Where Enterprise Workflow Optimization is Heading

**The 5-10 Year Vision:**

"In 5-10 years, embedded workflow prototyping becomes the standard for enterprise optimization. Here's what that looks like:

**Companies won't commit to massive implementations without validating first.** They'll use rapid, user-driven prototyping to discover what works, then scale what's proven. The days of 12-month consulting engagements that produce reports nobody uses? Those are ending.

**AI accelerates iteration, but user research drives direction.** The future isn't AI-first or user-first—it's both. AI tools let us prototype and test faster than ever, but understanding what actually needs to change comes from embedded user research.

**Validation happens in weeks, not months.** Enterprises will expect to see working prototypes and validated improvements in 4-5 weeks, not 6-12 months. Speed becomes table stakes.

**Embedded expertise becomes the norm.** Remote consulting from conference rooms? That's outdated. The future is embedded teams who understand actual workflows, not assumptions.

**Real data drives decisions, not vendor pitches.** Companies will demand prototypes grounded in real user behavior, not hypothetical designs or vendor assumptions.

**My role in shaping that future:** I'm building the model that makes this standard. Every enterprise workflow improvement starts with embedded validation, not assumptions. That's the vision."

**Tone:** Forward-looking, optimistic, but grounded  
**Use When:** They ask about vision, long-term plans, market direction

---

## PART 4: DIFFERENTIATION STORY (Woven Into Narrative)

### How to Present Differentiation (Not as a List, But as a Story)

**The Speed Story:**
*"At Amazon, we ran user research and design sprints in 2-4 weeks. That's the pace I bring to enterprise workflow optimization. While consultants take 6-12 months, I deliver validated prototypes in 4-5 weeks. That speed isn't just faster—it means companies can test multiple approaches before committing. That changes outcomes."*

**The Embedded Story:**
*"I've spent time on job sites in environmental consulting. I've been in defense research labs. I understand that being there matters. When I embed with teams, I'm not consulting from a distance—I'm understanding actual workflows, real constraints, how teams actually work. That's different from remote consulting, and it changes what I discover."*

**The Task Understanding + Agentic Reimagining Story:**
*"Most AI firms start with tech. Most design firms digitize existing processes. I do something different: I understand what users are actually trying to accomplish—the underlying task—then reimagine how agentic solutions can complete those tasks in fundamentally different ways. That intersection—task understanding plus agentic reimagining plus AI acceleration—is what makes this work. It's not just faster, it's fundamentally better. Traditional UX digitizes processes. I reshape task completion."*

**The Real Data Story:**
*"At Fidelity, everything is grounded in real user behavior. At Amazon, we tested everything. That's what I bring: prototypes grounded in actual workflows and user feedback, not hypothetical designs or vendor assumptions. Real data changes outcomes."*

**The Domain Expertise Story:**
*"I have credibility across multiple industries because I've been there. Financial services? I'm at Fidelity. E-commerce? I scaled Amazon Product Ads. Defense? I've done DARPA work. Construction? I have environmental consulting background. That multi-industry experience means I can credibly engage in each market."*

**The Proven Track Record Story:**
*"I've spent 20 years shipping products that work. At Amazon, I scaled Product Ads to $250M. At Fidelity, I'm designing systems millions use. That track record matters—I know how to uncover real user needs, design solutions that work, and bring teams along in transformation."*

**How to Use:**
- Don't list all six—pick 2-3 that are most relevant to the conversation
- Weave them into your story naturally
- Use specific examples (Amazon, Fidelity, DARPA)
- Connect to their experience if possible

## PART 5: ADAPTIVE VARIATIONS

### For Different Founder Types

**Tech Founders:**
*"I'm combining user research with AI acceleration—using AI tools to prototype and validate fast, but starting with understanding what actually needs to change. It's the intersection of design thinking and AI that changes outcomes."*

**B2B SaaS Founders:**
*"You're probably seeing the same enterprise workflow challenges I am. Companies struggle to validate improvements before committing. I help them discover what works in 4-5 weeks instead of 6-12 months—similar to how you validate product features fast."*

**Service Founders:**
*"You understand embedded client work—that's my model. I embed with teams for 4-5 weeks, understand their workflows, then prototype solutions. It's like consulting, but focused on rapid validation and prototyping."*

**Early-Stage Founders:**
*"You're validating fast—that's exactly what I help enterprises do. While they're used to 12-month consulting engagements, I bring startup speed: validate workflow improvements in 4-5 weeks, then scale what works."*

**Experienced Founders:**
*"I see a massive market opportunity—$500M-$1.5B globally. Enterprises are desperate for faster, cheaper workflow optimization. The unit economics are strong—LTV/CAC of 53:1. I'm building a new category: rapid workflow discovery and validation."*

## PART 6: PRACTICAL TIPS & TECHNIQUES

### Storytelling Best Practices

**Start with a Specific Moment (Not Abstract):**
- ❌ "Enterprises have workflow problems."
- ✅ "I kept seeing the same pattern: companies would spend months and millions on workflow improvements that didn't work."

**Use Concrete Examples:**
- "At Amazon, I scaled Product Ads to $250M."
- "At Fidelity, I'm designing systems for millions of users."
- "I've done DARPA work, environmental consulting, e-commerce."

**Show Vulnerability/Learning Moments:**
- "I kept seeing this gap..."
- "What I realized was..."
- "The insight that changed everything was..."

**End with Forward-Looking Vision:**
- "In 5-10 years, this becomes the standard..."
- "The vision is that every enterprise workflow improvement starts with validation..."
- "That's where I see this heading..."

**Leave Space for Questions:**
- Pause after key points
- Ask "Does that make sense?" or "Have you seen that?"
- Let them interrupt with questions

---

**"What's your business model?"**
*"I do 4-5 week embedded engagements—$40-60K average. Then optional retainers for ongoing optimization—$3-5K/month. The model is project-based plus retainer. Revenue mix shifts from 70% projects in Year 1 to 50/50 projects and retainers by Year 3."*

**"Are you raising capital?"**
*"I'm self-funded for now. The unit economics are strong—profitable from customer one, LTV/CAC of 53:1. I'm focused on validating the model with 2-3 customers first, then I'll evaluate if capital makes sense for scaling. Right now, I don't need it."*
