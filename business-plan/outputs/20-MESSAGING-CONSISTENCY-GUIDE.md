# MESSAGING CONSISTENCY GUIDE: Operations Intelligence Framework

## Purpose
This guide ensures the finalized Operations Intelligence messaging framework is consistently applied across all documentation. Use this as a reference when updating materials.

**Note:** LinkedIn updates planned for after March 1, 2025. This guide ensures consistency across all other materials.

---

## FINALIZED MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### Component 1: Business Tag
**Operations Intelligence**

### Component 2: Personal Title
**Principal, Operations Intelligence**

### Component 3: LinkedIn Description
"Principal at Operations Intelligence | I embed with teams to understand the outcomes they need, then reimagine how agentic solutions can accomplish them differently by prototyping and validating what actually works."

### Component 4: Mission Statement
"Operations Intelligence helps enterprises reshape operations by understanding the outcomes teams need and reimagining how agentic solutions can accomplish them differently—validated through rapid prototyping."

---

## KEY LANGUAGE CHANGES TO APPLY

### ✅ USE (New Language)

**Tag/Title:**
- Operations Intelligence (not "Workflow Intelligence", "AIX", "UX", "Forward Deployed AIX")

**Focus Language:**
- "Outcomes they need" (not "what needs to happen", "what users are trying to accomplish")
- "Outcomes teams need" (not "workflow problems", "process optimization")
- "Accomplish them differently" (not "digitize processes", "optimize workflows")
- "Reshape operations" (not "workflow optimization", "process improvement")

**Team Language:**
- "Teams" (not "enterprise teams" in description - enterprise is the client)
- "Embed with teams" (not "front-line workers" - too limiting)

**Method Language:**
- "By prototyping and validating" (not hyphenated, natural flow)
- "What actually works" (not "validated prototypes" as separate sentence)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ UX/AIX language
- ❌ "Workflow" as primary focus (use "operations")
- ❌ "What needs to happen" (too soft)
- ❌ "Enterprise teams" in description (enterprise is client)
- ❌ Hyphens/em dashes that look AI-generated
- ❌ Timeframes in LinkedIn description (can keep in pitches)
