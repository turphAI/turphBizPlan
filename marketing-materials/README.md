## Key Content Pieces

**One-Liner:**
"I help enterprises discover and validate workflow improvements by embedding with users and prototyping solutions grounded in real-world data."

**Elevator Pitch (60 seconds):**
"I help enterprises identify workflow opportunities through embedded prototyping. I embed directly with your teams for 4-5 weeks, using real data and rapid AI-accelerated prototyping to discover improvements, validate them with users, and provide an implementation roadmap. I combine my background scaling products at Amazon and designing interfaces at Fidelity with AI tools to help you move faster and reduce risk."

**Three Differentiators:**
1. Embedded with real users (not remote consulting)
2. Data-driven prototyping (real workflows, not assumptions)
3. AI-accelerated speed (rapid iteration vs. traditional consulting)
